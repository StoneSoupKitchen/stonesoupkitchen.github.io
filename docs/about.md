Stone Soup Kitchen is a platform dedicated to helping other developers learn
not just how to write software, but how to collaborate and how to deliver that
software. The goal of this wiki is to arm you, the reader, with the tools,
techniques, and practices that will help you to create good software for your
users.

## Naming origins

Stone Soup Kitchen is a portmanteau of two different ideas: "Stone Soup", a
tale of wandering travelers bringing together a village with a fantastical
stew, and "Soup Kitchen", a place where food is offered to the hungry, and is
typically operated by volunteers.

Both of these ideas come together to form the ethos of Stone Soup Kitchen:

> By sharing our talents with each other, we can make higher quality software
> than we could on our own.
