Stone Soup Kitchen is my own personal platform dedicated to helping other
developers learn not just how to write software, but how to collaborate and
how to deliver that software. The goal of this website is to arm you, the
reader, with the tools, techniques, and practices that will help you to create
good software for your users. A secondary goal is for me to learn to do the
same alongside you.

The name "Stone Soup Kitchen" is a portmanteau of two different ideas:
"Stone Soup", a tale of wandering travelers bringing together a village with
a fantastical stew, and "Soup Kitchen", a place where food is offered to the
hungry, and is typically operated by volunteers.

Both of these ideas come together to form the ethos of Stone Soup Kitchen:

> By sharing our talents with each other, we can make higher quality software
> than we could on our own.
